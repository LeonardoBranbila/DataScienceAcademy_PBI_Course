# DataScienceAcademy_PBI_Course
Repository with course dashes and datasets.

The Dashboards were not focused on having a great design, but rather on learning and replicating the concepts shown in the course and also on learning and understanding the features of the Power BI tool.

The data used (except for that in chapter 10) are fictitious data and I will not upload the course documents and PDFs here out of respect for them.
